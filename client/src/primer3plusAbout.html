        <h2>Fair use of Primer3 and Primer3Plus</h2>

        <p>
        The development of primer3 is promoted by a small group of 
        enthusiastic scientists mainly in their free time.They do not gain 
        any financial profit with primer3.<br>
        <br>
        There are two groups of primer3 users: end users, who run 
        primer3 to pick their primers and programmers, who use primer3 
        in their scripts or software packages. We encourage both to use 
        primer3.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you are an end user, we request but do not
        require that use of this software be cited in publications
        as listed above under CITING PRIMER3.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you are a programmer, you  will see that primer3 is now 
        distributed under the GNU  General Public License, version 3 or 
        (at  your option) any later version of the License (GPL3). 

        As we understand it, if you include parts of the primer3 source 
        code in your source code or link to primer3 binary libraries in 
        your executable, you have to release your software also under 
        GPL3. If you only call primer3 from your software and interpret 
        its output, you can use any license you want for your software. 
        If you modify primer3 and then release your modified software, 
        you have to release your modifications in source code under 
        GPL3 as well.
        <br>
        <br>
        We chose GPL3 because we wanted primer3 to evolve and for the 
        improvements to find their way back into the main distribution. 

        If you are programming a new web interface which runs primer3, 
        please include in the about page of the tool the sentence 
        "&lt;your software name&gt; uses primer3 version ...". 
        Please consider releasing your software under GPL3 as well, 
        especially if you do not want to maintain it in the future. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There is no need to ask us for permission to include primer3 
        in your tools.


        <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

        <p>Initial development of Primer3 was funded by Howard Hughes Medical
        Institute and by the National Institutes of Health, National Human
        Genome Research Institute under grants R01-HG00257 (to David C. Page)
        and P50-HG00098 (to Eric S. Lander),
        but ongoing development and maintenance are not currently funded.
        <br>
        <br>
        Primer3 was originally written by Helen J. Skaletsky (Howard Hughes
        Medical Institute, Whitehead Institute) and Steve Rozen (Duke-NUS
        Graduate Medical School Singapore, formerly at Whitehead Institute)
        based on the design of earlier versions, notably Primer 0.5
        (Steve Lincoln, Mark Daly, and Eric S. Lander).
        The original web interface was designed by Richard Resnick.  Lincoln
        Stein designed the Boulder-IO format in the days before XML and RDF, and
        championed the idea of making primer3 a software component, which
        has been key to its wide utility.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, among others, Ernst Molitor, Carl Foeller, and James Bonfield
        contributed to the early
        design of primer3. Brant Faircloth has helped with 
        ensuring that primer3 runs on Windows and MacOS and with the
        primer3 web site. 
        Triinu Koressaar and Maido Remm modernized the melting 
        temperature calculations in 2008.  
        Triinu Koressaar added secondary structure, 
        primer-dimer, and template mispriming based on a thermodynamic
        model in 2.2.0.
        Ioana Cutcutache is responsible for most of the 
        remaining improvements
        in 2.2.0, including performance enhancements, modern
        command line arguments, and new input tags to 
        control primer location (with the "overlap junction"
        tags initially implemented by Andreas Untergasser).
        Jian Ye patiently provided new requirements.<br>
        <br>
        Harm Nijveen and Andreas Untergasser developed the webinterface 
        Primer3Plus in 2006-2009. Currently Primer3Plus is maintained by 
        Andreas Untergasser and was rewritten in Python 2018.
        <br>
        <br>
        Primer3Plus and Primer3 are an open software development projects hosted
